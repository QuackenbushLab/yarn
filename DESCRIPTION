Description: Expedite large RNA-Seq analyses using a combination of previously developed tools.
    YARN is meant to make it easier for the user in performing basic mis-annotation quality control,
    filtering, and condition-aware normalization. YARN leverages many Bioconductor tools and statistical
    techniques to account for the large heterogeneity and sparsity found in very large RNA-seq experiments.
